# Once you are done with creating the test case using jmeter GUI check out the steps below

1. So basically a file suggestions.jmx test case will be created which you will refer in the shell script to actually perform the load test

    location - load_test/test_plans/suggestions.jmx
    
2. You do need an test data file which in this case is

    /load_test/cases/suggestions_input.csv

3. Finally the main shell script file which will combine all this information to trigger the load test script using CLI
   run_suggestions.sh
   
   Although the comments in this file are self elaborated. let me still try to explain as much as I can in detail
   
    All the below variables are created to provide the jmeter script location, the Test Plan location mentioned in the point 1,
    override some of the jquery user defined variables which we which were mentioned in '2. Manage Jmeter scripts.md' document
    
    These variables which we override are THREAD_COUNT, HOLD_TIME AND CSV_INPUT_FILE(input file created in step 2) and SAMPLES_PER_MIN
    
    Finally I have also provide the output directory by creating the variable RESULTS_DIR
   
    JMETER_BIN_PATH=~/jmeter/apache-jmeter-5.5/bin
    TEST_PLAN=./test_plans/suggestions.jmx
    THREAD_COUNT=2 # no.of concurrent users
    HOLD_TIME=60 # run peak load for 5 min
    CSV_INPUT_FILE=./cases/suggestions_input.csv
    RESULTS_DIR=./results/SUGGESTIONS
    #### enable this to override the default behaviour
    SAMPLES_PER_MIN=10
    
    I then also override the follwing user-defined variables in the shell script
    
    PROTOCOL=http
    BASE_URL=ec2-1-1-1-1.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
    PORT=3000
    ROUTE_PATH=suggestions
    API_KEY=dummy
    
 4. The key thing here is to run jmeter via CLI
    ~~~~sh
     ${JMETER_BIN_PATH}/jmeter \
    -JPROTOCOL=${PROTOCOL} \
    -JBASE_URL=${BASE_URL} \
    -JROUTE_PATH=${ROUTE_PATH} \
    -JPORT=${PORT} \
    -JAPI_KEY=${API_KEY} \
    -JTHREAD_COUNT=${THREAD_COUNT} \
    -JSAMPLES_PER_MIN=${SAMPLES_PER_MIN} \
    -JHOLD_TIME=${HOLD_TIME} \
    -JCSV_INPUT_FILE=${CSV_INPUT_FILE} \
    -n -t ${TEST_PLAN} \
    -l ${RESULTS_DIR}//aggregate_report.csv \
    -e -o ${RESULTS_DIR}/
    ~~~~

**Now why are we giving parameters like -JPROTOCOL, -JBASE_URL, -JPORT etc....(basically we are prefixing a 'J' in front of each user-defined variable which we created on jquery GUI. Answer lies in the following document**
   
   https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html#override
   
   -J[prop_name]=[value]
    defines a local JMeter property.
    
    jmeter -Jremote_hosts=127.0.0.1
    
  what about other options like -n, -l , -e, and -o
  checkout the following link
  https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html#non_gui
  
  
  -n -> [This specifies JMeter is to run in cli mode]
  -l -> [name of JTL file to log sample results to]
  -e -> [generate report dashboard after load test]
  -o -> [output folder where to generate the report dashboard after load test. **Folder must not exist or be empty]**
  
  Do notice that -o has mentioned that the output folder either must not exsit or must be empty
  
  so that is why I running -> 
  ~~~~sh
  rm -rf ${RESULTS_DIR} && mkdir -p ${RESULTS_DIR} 
  ~~~~
  before executing the jquery command!!!!
