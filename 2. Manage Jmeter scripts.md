# Steps to create scripts/artifacts as part of this repository
### Run the Jmeter GUI to create Test file /load_test/test_plans/suggestions.jmx
1. ~/jmeter/apache-jmeter-5.5/bin/jmeter
1. In the Jmeter GUI start creating a new test plan  
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109071677/179281713-71c0d573-94bd-4026-b886-d160932365b5.png)
1. Provide name to test plan and create 'user defined variables'
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109071677/179282014-370a1c49-f143-4f14-822c-cb2a02f290e7.png)
   
   https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/functions.html
   
   https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#using_variables
   
   Properties are not the same as variables. Variables are local to a thread; properties are common to all threads, and need to be referenced using the __P or __property function.
   
   1. PROTOCOL - could be http or https (based on your connection)
   2. BASE_URL - could be localhost or e.g. api.dev.response.net
   3. PORT     - port through which you will be connect or test your web URL
   4. API_KEY  - api_key for your url
   5. ROUTE_PATH - which API route you want to test
      e.g. overall URL will be like http://localhost:3000/suggestions?api_key=xxxxx
   6. THREAD_COUNT - # no.of concurrent users
      e.g. as part of load test you should test scenario where multiple users are accessing your application to test how robust your application here
      the more you increase the THREAD_COUNT the more effectively you will be able to verify load test.
      
      https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#thread_group
      
      The controls for a thread group allow you to:

      Set the number of threads
      Set the ramp-up period
      Set the number of times to execute the test
      Each thread will execute the test plan in its entirety and completely independently of other test threads. Multiple threads are used to simulate concurrent connections to your server application.
      
      The ramp-up period tells JMeter how long to take to "ramp-up" to the full number of threads chosen. If 10 threads are used, and the ramp-up period is 100 seconds, then JMeter will take 100 seconds to get all 10 threads up and running. Each thread will start 10 (100/10) seconds after the previous thread was begun. If there are 30 threads and a ramp-up period of 120 seconds, then each successive thread will be delayed by 4 seconds.

      Ramp-up needs to be long enough to avoid too large a work-load at the start of a test, and short enough that the last threads start running before the first ones finish (unless one wants that to happen).
   
   7. HOLD_TIME - the 'Duration' field in the Thread Group will hold the ${HOLD_TIME} -> which will define how long a test will run

      https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/test_plan.html#thread_group
   8. CSV_INPUT_FILE - here you provide the test data file location which will be used to perform the load test
   9. SAMPLES_PER_MIN - this is a property of Constant Troughput Timer -> Target Throughput(in samples per minute)
   
      this defines the on an average how many test records will be handled by Jmeter enginer to perform the load test
   
      https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#Constant_Throughput_Timer
      
1. Create the Thread Group and provide THREAD_COUNT and HOLD_TIME that you created as part user defined variables as mentioned in the screenshot below
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109071677/179286341-c431b448-c9a0-4f40-b561-8a5312c2ed23.png)
   
   Thread Group also allows to specify Thread lifetime. Click the checkbox at the bottom of the Thread Group panel to enable/disable extra fields in which you can enter the duration of test and the startup delay You can configure Duration (seconds) and Startup Delay (seconds) to control the duration of each thread group and the after how much seconds it starts. When the test is started, JMeter will wait Startup Delay (seconds) before starting the Threads of the Thread Group and run for the configured Duration (seconds) time.
   

1. Then Create an HTTP request

   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109071677/179289611-ed63dec3-3ab1-4ef8-bcfb-cfd4dd06793c.png)
   
   so this is how you need to provide different user defined variables that you created as part of Thread Group. The variables are
   PROTOCOL, BASE_URL, ROUTE_PATH
   
   Also there are different query parameters you need to define as part of your overall API url in the 'Parameters' section. These are
   query, search_center, and api_key
   for api_key -> provide the user defined variable
   for query, search_center -> these will be fetched from the CSV_INPUT_FILE .....(will come back to this file later in the document!!!)

1. Create a CSV Data Set Config

   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109071677/179290593-56e9afa7-946e-4494-826d-32b7ab8ab477.png)
   
   here you will provide the CSV_INPUT_FILE -> user defined variable. Now what you need to understand is this file contains 2 data columns
   
   e.g.
   query|search_center
   TEXAS|42.0001,-72.1091
   
   so basically you need to setup 'Variable Names', 'Ignore First Line', 'Delimiter', and other properties as mentioned in the screenshot above
   
1. Do add HTTP Cache Manager

   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109071677/179291445-fac08244-f400-4726-8dae-174da6eb698b.png)
   
1. And HTTP Header Manager
    
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109071677/179291516-5f4a49a4-f89e-469c-91c7-d4489a6d431a.png)

1. And Constant Throughput Time
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109071677/179291600-bae76b25-e1d9-46f2-95d3-cd37bc1c21d7.png)

1. Finally Add the 'Listeners' to this test case -> so Listeners are basically the Targets where you can see the results of the load test that you are running

   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109071677/179291981-feb88d3a-8923-4132-8128-f7b4dfdee151.png)

   in this case we want following outputs/listeners
   
   'View Results in Table'
   'View Result Tree'
   'Summary Report'
