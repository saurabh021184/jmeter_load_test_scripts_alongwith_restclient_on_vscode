###Post execution just check the files getting created in the folder load_test/results/SUGGESTIONS (note: this folder is not part of this repo. as it will be created automatically)
files/folder inside this will be somthing like:
- index.html
- statistics.json
- aggregate_report.csv
- .....

basically just check index.html  -> and it will generate a load test report which is the end result of this entire exercise!!!!
